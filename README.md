📌 Overview

Flask allows you to handle web requests using HTTP methods like GET and POST. These methods help you send data to and from the server.


🔹 GET Method

Used to retrieve data from the server

Data is sent through the URL (query parameters)

Not secure for sensitive information

Ideal for search, filters, reading data



🔹 POST Method

Used to send data to the server

Data is sent in the request body, not in the URL

More secure compared to GET

Ideal for login forms, registration, uploading data
